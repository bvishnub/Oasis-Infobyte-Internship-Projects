- **Marketing and Engagement Initiatives**:

  - Run special promotions and offers on historically high-sales days (3rd-7th, 25th).
  - Increase branding and advertising for low-performing malls like Forum Istanbul and Emaar Square Mall.
  - Introduce games and activities based on clothing and cosmetics to attract larger footfall in malls.

- **Product Offering Adjustments**:
  - Create bundle offers for products that are frequently bought together, particularly in high-quantity sales categories.

- **Increase Payment Method Diversity**:
  - Given the significant percentage of online transactions, consider integrating additional online payment options like mobile wallets.

- **Monitor and Analyze Performance Regularly**:
  - Track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as customer retention rate, average transaction value, and conversion rates from marketing campaigns.
  - Implement A/B testing for marketing messages and promotions to determine the most effective strategies for various customer segments.

- **Sales Timing Strategy**:
  - Launch sales or promotions at the beginning of the month to capitalize on observed peak shopping days.
