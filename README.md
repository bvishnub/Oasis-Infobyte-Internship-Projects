## Project 1: EDA on Retail Sales Data - Istanbul Malls

### Overview
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of retail sales data from shopping malls in Istanbul. The analysis explores customer behavior, revenue trends, product categories, and payment methods.

### Key Highlights
- Analyzed revenue trends over time, identifying significant declines in 2023.
- Explored customer demographics, including gender, age, and purchase behavior.
- Provided actionable insights and recommendations for improving customer retention and mall performance.

**Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Project 2: EDA on Google Play Store Data

### Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis on Google Play Store data to understand app performance, user ratings, and sentiment analysis of user reviews.

### Key Highlights
- Analyzed app download trends by categories, genres, and age groups.
- Explored user ratings and sentiments, providing insights for app developers.
- Highlighted popular app categories and the relationship between app size, ratings, and user sentiment.

**Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Google Colab

For more details, refer to the [Play Store App Review Analysis Notebook].

## Project 3: Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset of transaction records.

### Key Highlights
- Used various machine learning techniques to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.
- Applied data preprocessing and oversampling (SMOTE) techniques to address class imbalance.
- Evaluated models based on accuracy, recall, and ROC-AUC score.

**Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

For more details, refer to the [Credit Card Fraud Detection Notebook].
